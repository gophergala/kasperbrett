# Kasperbrett
A dead simple dashboard creation software created in the course of the [Gopher Gala](http://gophergala.com/).



## Caveats
* Time is limited at the Gopher Gala and I don't want to deal with managing own packages. That's why all the Go code for Kasperbrett is in one package (and probably even within one file). Code quality might also be very rough because the goal is to create a running prototype.
